# social_media_feed

A backend service for secure social media interactions with end-to-end encryption.

## Overview

This repository contains the backend implementation for a social media feed application with a focus on privacy and security through end-to-end encryption. The service handles user authentication, content storage, and encrypted communication between users.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All user content and communications are encrypted to ensure privacy: *Not pushed to public repo for now*
- **Secure User Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication and secure session management
- **Content Management**: API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and interacting with encrypted posts
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle high traffic and growing user bases

## Future Developments

- **Conversational Swarm Intelligence**: Enhanced collaboration features for professional groups
- The Backend may be rewritten in GO, as this project is being made with intention that people use this.

## Security Model

The application implements a comprehensive security model:

1. **Transport Layer Security**: All API communications use HTTPS
2. **Key Management**: User encryption keys are never stored on the server
3. **Zero-Knowledge Design**: The server cannot decrypt user content
